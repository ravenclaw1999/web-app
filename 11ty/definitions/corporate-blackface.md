the idea that corporations declare support of the Black Lives Matter movement, without actually committing to implementing real change within their company

## Examples

- For example, a company tweets Black Lives Matter. But the company has a toxic work culture, and discriminates against its Black employees. It refuses to enact effective policies or diversify its teams, and yet, it has the audacity to post a soldarity statement, claiming to support Black lives.
