the idea that corporations publicly declare support of the Black Lives Matter movement, often with vague language, without actually committing to or implementing real, systemic change within their company to support Black employees, clients, customers, and community

## Examples

- For example, a company tweets Black Lives Matter. But the company has a toxic work culture, and discriminates against its Black employees. It refuses to enact effective policies or diversify its teams, and yet, it has the audacity to post a soldarity statement, claiming to support Black lives.
